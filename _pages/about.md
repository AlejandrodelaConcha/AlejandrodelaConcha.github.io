I am Alejandro de la Concha, a PhD researcher in Statistical Machine Learning at the École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Prof. Nicolas Vayatis and Argyris Kalogeratos. 

My thesis focuses on developing graph-based machine learning techniques for analyzing data generated in complex systems such as transport systems, financial networks, sensor networks, to name a few. My work includes contributions to the subfields of 1) kernel methods and hypothesis testing. 2) density/likelihood-ratio estimation. 3) graph-signal processing. 

Professionally, I have held positions in public and private institutions, where I have mainly focused on applying machine learning to risk management. I held a Research Data Scientist position at Financial Network Analytics ([FNA](https://fna.fi/)) and a Financial Risk Analyst position at the Central Bank of Mexico ([BANXICO](https://www.banxico.org.mx/indexen.html)) within the Directorate of Risk Management.
